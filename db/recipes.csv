This seasoning has nothing to do with fish, instead imitating the seasoning and method, which people in Sichuan use when cooking fish.

They always put some green onion, ginger, garlic, soy, vinegar, wine and so on when they cook fish. One day, the wife put the remaining seasoning from last night into the food because she did not want to waste the seasoning. She at first thought her husband would not like it, but unexpectedly, he liked it very much.

Nanjing Salted Duck,English,Jiangsu,"1. Rinse the duck thoroughly under cold water, discarding any of the giblets that came with it. Soak it in cold water for an hour to get rid of any impurities.

2. In the meantime, add the salt and Sichuan peppercorns to a flat-bottomed pan over medium heat. Dry roast them by stirring constantly for 5-8 minutes until the salt turns slightly yellow. Turn off the heat and let cool. Be sure not to burn the Sichuan peppercorns.

3. Drain the duck from the water and thoroughly pat it dry with paper towels, inside and out. Rub the salt and Sichuan peppercorns all over the duck, inside and out. Use all of the mixture, making sure that you use at least ⅓ for the cavity. Let the duck marinate, uncovered, for three hours in the refrigerator.

4.While the duck is marinating, you can prepare your spice pouch. Place the star anise, cumin seeds, bay leaves, cinnamon, and peppercorns on a square of cheesecloth and tie tightly with kitchen twine. Set aside.

5. Next, prepare a pot that is big enough to cook the duck whole. Fill it with 12-15 cups of water, enough to submerge the whole duck. Add the spice pouch along with the ginger and scallion. Bring the pot of water to a boil, and add the Shaoxing wine. Simmer over low heat.

6. Once the duck is finished marinating, carefully lower it (along with all the salt and Sichuan peppercorns used to marinate it) in the prepared pot. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, carefully lift the duck out of the water in order to drain the water that has accumulated in the cavity; then lower it back into the pot, and bring the water to a boil again. This ensures there is no cold water trapped inside the cavity of the duck.

7. Immediately turn the heat down to a simmer, cover, and let cook for 15 minutes. During these 15 minutes, the water should be hot and simmering slightly, but it shouldn't be at a full boil. After 15 minutes, turn off the heat and let the pot sit, covered, for 40–45 minutes. Once the 40-45 minutes has passed, transfer the duck to a cutting board.

Xiao Long Bao recipe might differ from one cuisine to another. However Shanghai style is the most dedicate and elegant version.

Its origins are somewhat debatable as everyone wants to lay claim to such a popular dish, but most agree that the story begins around 1875 in the Shanghai suburb of Nanxiang. A man named Huang Mingxian decided he could attract customers to his restaurant by creating a surprising new dumpling.

To create the soupy interior, he added aspic to his pork mince so that, upon steaming, the aspic would liquefy and fill the dumpling with soup from the inside. The thin dough wrapper had to be pleated exactly 14 times, creating a small, circular cinching at the top. To steam, the dumplings were placed in a round bamboo basket. Huang would call the dish Nanxiang da rou mantou, which roughly translates to Nanxiang large meat bun. He figured that the actually petite size of the dish would make it memorable and create loyal fans.

Huang was right.

People began flocking to his restaurant from all over, taken with the novelty. As more and more people tried the dish, the name morphed into a more appropriate one, and thus Xiao (small) Long (basket) Bao (bun) were born.",1 hr,1875,mild,0,230,5500,https://chinasichuanfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/xiao-long-bao-26.jpg,,My Cookbook

","General Tso's chicken (pronounced [tswò]) is a sweet deep-fried chicken dish that is served in North American Chinese restaurants (it is also seen with other variants, such as General Tse's chicken). The dish is named after Zuo Zongtang (also romanized Tso Tsung-t'ang), a Qing dynasty statesman and military leader, although there is no recorded connection to him nor is the dish known in Hunan, Zuo's home province.

The dish has been associated with Zuo Zongtang (Tso Tsung-t'ang) (1812–1885), a Qing dynasty statesman and military leader from Hunan Province, but Zuo could not have eaten the dish or known of it.[2] The dish is found neither in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, nor in Xiangyin County, where Zuo was born. Moreover, Zuo's descendants, who are still living in Xiangyin County, when interviewed, say that they have never heard of such a dish.

There are several stories concerning the origin of the dish. Eileen Yin-Fei Lo states in her book The Chinese Kitchen that the dish originates from a simple Hunan chicken dish and that the reference to ""Zongtang"" was not a reference to Zuo Zongtang's given name, but rather a reference to the homonym ""zongtang"", meaning ""ancestral meeting hall"".[4] Consistent with this interpretation, the dish name is sometimes (but considerably less commonly) found in Chinese as 左宗棠雞 (Chung tong gai is transliterated from Jyutping[citation needed]; Zuǒ Zōngtáng jī is transliterated from Hanyu Pinyin).",20 mins,1910,mild,60,634,5454,https://therecipecritic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/0C4A8446.jpg,,My Cookbook
Steamed Spare Ribs with Black Beans,English,Cantonese,"1. Place the rib pieces, sugar, salt, wine, sesame oil and white pepper into a bowl and mix until the ribs are coated. Cover and let them marinate in the fridge overnight for best results. If you're strapped for time, 30 minutes is the minimum marinating time. Add cornstarch and water to the marinated ribs and mix well. With the cornstarch, there should be little or no liquid in the mixture.

2. Place the ribs on a heatproof plate for steaming. We used small dim sum style plates as you can see in the photos, but you can use a large, shallow heat-proof bowl for the whole batch. Once you have plated the ribs, sprinkle the peppers and the fermented black beans over the top.

3. Next, bring some water to a simmer in a metal steamer or in a wok with a steaming rack set in the bottom. Place the plate(s) into your steamer apparatus, cover, and steam for 10 minutes, or until the ribs are opaque and cooked through. Serve as dim sum or as a delicious one plate meal over rice!","In addition to being a classic, steamed spare ribs with fermented black beans is also one of the easiest dim sum recipes to make. While it’s not that obvious how to reproduce the flavor, once you check out the ingredients and breeze through making it for the first time, you’ll want to make
it all the time! You’ll be amazed at how close these steamed ribs taste to restaurant dim sum, and you can even adjust the recipe to your own personal tastes.

Butchers at Asian markets usually sell pork ribs that are already cut into small pieces. If you don’t have an Asian market nearby, you can ask your local butcher to do the same, or make use of a good Chinese cleaver. Just watch your fingers! Onsecond thought, it’s best not to try this at home unless you have experienced knife skills; let the butcher take care of it.",1 hours 10 mins,N/A,mild,20,232,888,https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dim-sum-spare-ribs-feature.jpg,,
Clay Pot Rice Bowl,English,Cantonese,"1. Soak your cup of rice in (exactly) a cup of water in your clay pot for an hour (see bottom of the post for instructions on making this in your trusty rice cooker).

2. After it’s been soaked, put the pot over medium heat and bring it to a boil. When it’s boiling, put the cured meats on top of the rice (don’t stir at this point. Just plop ’em in.). Also check out Judy’s recipe for homemade cured pork belly – it’s easy-to-make and totally worth the effort! Cover the pot, turn the heat down to the lowest setting, and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. In a small bowl, mix together the soy sauces, fish sauce, sugar, and white pepper.

3. After the ten minutes have elapsed, uncover the pot and pour the sauce evenly over the rice. Cover it back up and simmer for another 3 minutes.

4. After that, uncover the pot, slice up the meats, and add them back to the pot along with your chopped scallion. Add more soy sauce if you like!

5. And now, the best part. Stir everything together. Ready to serve!
