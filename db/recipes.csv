Yuxiang (sometimes translated as ""fish flavor"") is made of paolajiao, Chuan salt, soy, white sugar, bruised ginger, garlic and green star but no fish. This seasoning has nothing to do with fish, instead imitating the seasoning and method, which people in Sichuan use when cooking fish. The seasoning contains salty, sweet, sour, hot, and fresh tastes, making the food more delicious.

It is said that, many years ago, a family liked eating fish very much and they were particular with the seasoning. They always put some green onion, ginger, garlic, soy, vinegar, wine and so on when they cook fish. One day, the wife put the remaining seasoning from last night into the food because she did not want to waste the seasoning. She at first thought her husband would not like it, but unexpectedly, he liked it very much.

Later, this food was improved by many Sichuan people. Other dishes using yuxiang have also appeared in Sichuan menus, for example, as yuxiang pork liver, yuxiang eggplant, and yuxiang three silk (魚香三絲).",30 mins,recent decades,mild,20,325,677,https://i.pinimg.com/564x/bd/46/b4/bd46b459dc5b466ec9fccb0be4626861.jpg,,My Cookbook,Zoe,password,

Once the beans are somewhat tender, take them out of the wok and set aside.

This dish is also known as Szechuan dry-fried green beans of Chinese stir-fried green beans but if the restaurant is any good, they are prepared using the same method and quite tasty.

Deep-frying makes a healthy ingredient very unhealthy. However, when you think about the name of the dish in Chinese, 干煸四季豆(ganbian sijidou), it literally means “dry seared.” So rather than deep-frying the green beans (a method used in restaurants because it’s a faster process), I did just that—seared them in a dry wok without oil.

Spicy Chicken,English,Sichuan,"Marinating

-- 1 tbsp. rice wine
-- ¼ tsp. white pepper powder
-- 2 tsp. cornstarch ,optional
-- small pinch of salt

1.Cut the dried chili peppers, discard the seeds and then soak the peppers in water for 15 minutes. We are doing this so we can fry the peppers later and prevent burn the peppers.

2.Remove the bone of the chicken thighs and then cut into small cubes. In a large bowl, marinade the chicken cubes with all the marinating sauce. Mix well and set aside for around 10 minutes.

3. Heat up oil in wok or pan for deep-frying. Heat until really hot (you can see bubbles when you put a chopstick in). Add the chicken cubes in and fry until golden brown. Transfer out. I recommend using a pan and fry the chicken by batches. On one side, it uses less oil and on the other side, the chicken is widely touched with the bottom of the pan, which can speed up the process greatly. After add the chicken cubes, let it stay for a short time (possible about 40 seconds to 1 minute) until one side is browed and then slightly stir the chicken and fry the other side.

4.Get a clean wok and add only 1/2 tablespoon of oil and then fry the peppers for 1-2 minutes over slowest fire until most of them becomes dark red. Add Sichuan peppercorn in and continue frying for another 1 minute over slowest fire.

you might not have dared touch it for fear of burning a hole through your mouth. All those chili peppers can be intimidating, but I promise it is not as spicy as it looks, and you will love it to death!
